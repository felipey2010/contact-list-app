# Contact List App

This project was developed with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) and uses [JSON SERVER](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

This app applies the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) concept for a list of contacts.

## Starting the project

First, start the JSON server by running the command:

### `npm run db`

or

### `yarn run db`

In a separate terminal, run the main project with the command:

### `npm start`

or

### `yarn start`
