# Contact List App

This web app was created with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) and hosted on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/).

Some of the concepts used in the creation of this project are:
*Hooks for the inputs;
*Context to share data through the whole project;
*The use of an API hosted on Heroku to store and delete the contacts;
*Icons from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/);
*The database used is MongoDB;
*Fast loading with the use of [Lazy Loading](https://blog.bitsrc.io/lazy-loading-react-components-with-react-lazy-and-suspense-f05c4cfde10c);
*The loading bars provided by [React Spinners](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/);
*The notification toasts were from [Notistack library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notistack).
